Website for McLaren Formula 1 team: during a Grand Prix the dashboard displays live car telemetry and realtime comments from the team.

Evolution of the 2010 site with two goals; to make the data shown on the site more understandable to casual race fans and increase interaction with social media channels.

I led the development team and did backend development on this project.
