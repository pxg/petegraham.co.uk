Website to stop food wastage for Sainsbury's and Google. Built the search which returned relevant recipe suggestions based on the user's input ingredients. Data cleaning was required to import Sainsbury's products and recipes. CMS created to match products to recipes, and match user search inputs to Sainsbury's products.
