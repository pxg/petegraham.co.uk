An app which can recognise bird species from audio recordings. We worked with Queen Maryâ€™s College who had created the audio classifier using Machine Learning techniques. My role included everything from the initial UI prototypes and iOS app development, through to building an API around the classifier code and provisioning servers for it to run on.
