Data visualisation piece for Mindshare, to showcase the information they gather from their surveys. We were given the challenge to showcase it in a way which is interesting and understandable to the person on the street.

My role involved the initial investigation into the raw data and its format. Then working with the creatives and developers to look into visual techniques to display this information.
