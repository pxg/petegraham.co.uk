TODO: add why to upgrade to python 3. Link to other article
Approach:

TODO: overview of site and complexity. Basic functionality. Multi-step form. Email. CMS. PDF extrac

1. Upgrade Django version from 1.5 to 1.8????
2. Upgrade other libraries to latest Python 2.7 versions
3. Run 2 to 3 migrations tools
4. Run site on Python 3

##
Time to test the new site now we've upgraded packages. Yes more manual testing! I really missed my calling at a QA.

Is the fun over? Hell no it's just started as we'll be upgrading to Python 3 in the next part!
