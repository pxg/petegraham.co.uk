Growing up I liked trainers. I especially liked shiny futurisitic trainers. As any youth of the 90s can confirm the undisbuted king of futurisitic trainers was Nike, although Rebook Pump were a strong contender. I'm not a big fan of brands, so it's testimate to Nike that as an adult I still get excited by a nice pair of Air Jordan's or Nike Dunk's. So I've been keen to read Shoe Dog, the Story of Phil Knight the founder of Nike for some time.

I enjoyed the book, with the company on the verge of going bust multiple times, it's a page turner, expecially for a for a business autobiography. Knight's maverick business style means the book has it's fair share of ancedotes.

It's a inspirational book, so much so that I went out and did some jogging (although wearing ASICCS, sorry phil). The only other book which has had this effect is Born to run.

It starts with Knight as a shy 20 something who's trained as as an accountant (confirm this), his path is long and winding with him living in Hawaii and travelling the world before finally following his "crazy dream" of importing Japanese shoes to America. I was surprised to learn initially the company was called Blue Ribbon (inc?). The decision to start manufacturing Nike shoes didn't happen much later until XXXX and was due to not mangaging to secure an exclusive trade deal with Oxxxx tiger, and a contract screw job worry of a WWE story line.

The Nike name only comes about when they need a name for their own line of shoes, Knigh himself mentions he wasn't in love with the the name or the Swoosh initially, which is amazing considering how iconic now both are. Which just goes to prove that naming things is hard!

The early Nike leadeship team is dipicted as a rag tag bunch of misfits with unique skills. It's clear that company culture (over used) was a key to Nike's success, and they had a almost punk like approach (althouh some of the book is pre punk?).

Innovation clear comes accross as a key part of the Nike culture, with them expimenting with first the waffle trainer and later the air (sole).

Nike held off going public for a long time, even though they desperately needed the cash injection this could provide, this is because they feared it would ruin the culture by turning them coporate.

"Just do it" absent
Nike town (Apple store). Talk about Nike+ and Nike IDs (pay good money for Air Graham's)

I was slightly dissapointed not to hear more about Air Jordan's after throughrally enjoying the abstract

Only leads to 1980. Last chapter present day 2007?

More about air Jordan and shoe models. Abstract documentary Netflix.
Clothing very late (year). However this probably only seems like an obvious thing for Nike to do in hindsight due to their huge success
