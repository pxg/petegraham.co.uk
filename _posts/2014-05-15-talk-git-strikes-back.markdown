Here are the [slides](/slides/git_strikes_back.pdf) for part 2 of the talks about Git I've been giving at [HMTL - Loosers talking about rubbish](http://hmtl6.github.io/) meet-up.

[Part 1](http://hmtl6.github.io/2013-11-20-tramp/) was done on a whiteboard so they aren't any slides. For people really interested in Git I recommend reading [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book), which is available online for free! I'd like to thank the authors of Pro Git for shamelessly stealing their diagrams.
