After proof reading my [Python 3 and Swift](/the-python-3-problem-and-swift/) article [James Cooke](http://jamescooke.info/) asked if I'd be interested in talking at the [London Django Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/The-London-Django-Meetup-Group/) about upgrading an Django website from Python 2 to 3.

Slides are [online](/slides/django-and-python-3/) and the video is on the [skills matter website](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6509-london-django-august-2015-meetup).

The slides are fairly brief. I'll be writing about my experience of upgrading the site I talked about in an up coming article.
