I had the pleasure of speaking at Pycon UK this year. I talked about Python and functional programming. I've become increasingly interested in functional programming since starting [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun) on Coursera.

The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Gm-EvTA30U) is on YouTube. The [slides](/slides/functional-programming.pdf) are available too.

One of the stand out talks for me was [Using python to improve government](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq1fD_fBw7U) by Michael Brunton-Spall, [Jessica McKellar's keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI_RPSbsRw8).
